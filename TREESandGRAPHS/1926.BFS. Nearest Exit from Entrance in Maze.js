//4TH- INPUT FORMAT: MATRIX
// (row, col) of the matrix is a node, and the neighbors are:
//(row - 1, col), (row, col - 1), (row + 1, col), (row, col + 1)
// A NODE is a village and the there are 4 likely villages
// load into a Map structure (adjacence list)
// we do not load from input array to a Map of adjacence list because we already know
// who are the neighbours (the four nodes around it)

// BFS uses Queue for the cells to visit in the future
//   - 1ยบ: nodes with distance 0, 2ยบ nodes with distance 1, 3ยบ nodes with distance 2....
//   - inside the Queue can be nodes of two different levels

// Example 1:

// Explanation: There are 3 exits in this maze at [1,0], [0,2], and [2,3].
// Initially, you are at the entrance cell [1,2].
// - You can reach [1,0] by moving 2 steps left.
// - You can reach [0,2] by moving 1 step up.
// It is impossible to reach [2,3] from the entrance.
// Thus, the nearest exit is [0,2], which is 1 step away.

// [1,0] does not count as an exit since it is the entrance cell.
// Initially, you are at the entrance cell [1,0].
