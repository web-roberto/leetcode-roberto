// Example 1:
// Input: heights = [[1,2,2],[3,8,2],[5,3,5]]
// Output: 2
// Explanation: The route of [1,3,5,3,5] has a maximum absolute difference of 2 in consecutive cells.
// This is better than the route of [1,2,2,2,5], where the maximum absolute difference is 3.

// Example 2:
// Input: heights = [[1,2,3],[3,8,4],[5,3,5]]
// Output: 1
// Explanation: The route of [1,2,3,4,5] has a maximum absolute difference of 1 in consecutive cells, which is better than route [1,3,5,3,5].

// Example 3:
// Input: heights = [[1,2,1,1,1],[1,2,1,2,1],[1,2,1,2,1],[1,2,1,2,1],[1,1,1,2,1]]
// Output: 0
// Explanation: This route does not require any effort.
